### Slide Structure:

**Slide 1: Title Slide**
- Transport Routing REST API
- Helsinki Public Transport Route Planning
- For Andrea's Daily Commute Solution

**Slide 2: Problem Statement**
- Andrea needs to know departure times from Aalto Yliopisto to Keilaniemi
- Must arrive at KONE Building by 08:45 on weekdays
- Requires automated email notifications by 06:00
- Needs REST API (not familiar with GraphQL)

**Slide 3: Solution Overview**
- REST API wrapper around Helsinki Digitransit GraphQL API
- AWS Lambda + API Gateway deployment
- FastAPI framework with Pydantic validation
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

**Slide 4: Architecture Diagram**
- Client Request → API Gateway → Lambda Function → Digitransit API
- CloudWatch for logging and monitoring
- S3 + CloudFront for documentation
- Secrets Manager for API keys
- ElastiCache for performance optimization

**Slide 5: API Endpoints**
- GET /routes - Main route planning endpoint
- GET /health - Health check endpoint
- GET /docs - Interactive API documentation
- Parameters: arrival_time, start_stop, end_stop

**Slide 6: Key Features**
- ✅ REST API with OpenAPI documentation
- ✅ AWS CDK Infrastructure as Code
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (unit + integration)
- ✅ CloudWatch logging and metrics
- ✅ Production-ready error handling
- ✅ CORS enabled for web applications

**Slide 7: Technology Stack**
- Backend: Python 3.11, FastAPI, Pydantic
- Infrastructure: AWS CDK, Lambda, API Gateway
- Testing: pytest, pytest-cov, pytest-asyncio
- Monitoring: CloudWatch, AWS PowerTools
- Documentation: OpenAPI/Swagger

**Slide 8: Testing Strategy**
- Unit Tests: Models, client, handlers
- Integration Tests: End-to-end API workflows
- Performance Tests: Concurrent request handling
- Validation Tests: Edge cases and error scenarios

**Slide 9: Deployment Process**
- CDK Bootstrap (one-time setup)
- CDK Deploy (automated infrastructure)
- CloudFormation stack creation
- API Gateway endpoint provisioning
- Lambda function deployment

**Slide 10: Monitoring & Observability**
- CloudWatch Logs for debugging
- Custom metrics for API usage
- Health check endpoints
- Error tracking and alerting
- Performance monitoring

**Slide 11: Future Enhancements**
- ElastiCache for response caching
- Secrets Manager for API key rotation
- CloudFront + S3 for documentation hosting
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Multi-region deployment

**Slide 12: Demo**
- Live API demonstration
- Sample request/response
- API documentation interface
- CloudWatch logs and metrics

**Slide 13: Questions & Discussion**
- Technical implementation details
- Scalability considerations
- Security best practices
- Maintenance and operations
